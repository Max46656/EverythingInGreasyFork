# ThreadsS1KProblem

~~Delete ".0" in Threads interact stat when it's over 1K, which should be an integer instead of a float.~~  
Since the official Threads has fixed this bug,  
the purpose of this script is reduced to changing the .0萬 in the CJK counting method to an integer when setting the Threads language to CJK,  
which is an error when converting from x0k to x萬.
